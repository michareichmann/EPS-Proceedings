In addition to the radiation studies it is also very important to understand the signal behaviour of \ac{CVD} diamonds depending on the incident particle flux since the \ac{HL-LHC} will reach values in the low \SI{}{\giga\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} range. In order to conduct such a study it is important to have the possibility to vary the particle flux in big range. The $\uppi$M1 beam line at the \ac{HIPA} at \ac{PSI} can provide beams with continuously tunable fluxes from the order of \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} which have a spacing of \SI{19.8}{\nano\second} between each bunch. For these studies a $\uppi^{\z{+}}$ beam with with a momentum of \SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt\per c} was chosen in order to reach the highest possible flux.\par

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SETUP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The diamond sensors were measured in a pad geometry and prepared as described in \cite{rainer}. 
% They have a size of approximately \SI{4x4}{\milli\meter} with a chrome-gold metalisation of \SI{3.5x3.5}{\milli\meter} plus a guard ring on front and back side. 
In order to resolve single waveforms at high particle rates the sensors are connected to a fast, low-noise amplifier with a rise time of approximately \SI{5}{\nano\second}. The resulting waveforms are then read out with a DRS4 Evaluation Board at a sampling frequency of \SI{2}{\giga\hertz}. The final diamond pad detectors are then brought into a beam telescope based on the CMS pixel \acp{ROC} PSI46v2 \cite{kornmayer} which provides precise tracking with a resolution of \SI{\sim70}{\micro\meter} as well as a trigger which can be scaled in area to increase the efficiency of the data taking. A scintillator is positioned at the end of the telescope as additional trigger to achieve a precise timing of \SI{1}{\nano\second}.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ANALYSIS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An overlay of 30000 resulting waveforms is shown in Figure \vref{rate2}. The most frequent peak at \SI{70}{\nano\second} relates to the actual particle which was triggered on and is called signal region. All the other peaks are from particles of other bunches. Due to the good timing resolution the bunch spacing of the \ac{PSI} beam can be clearly seen in the plot. The bunch just before the signal region is forbidden by the trigger logic. Therefore there are no peaks in this area and it is used to extract the pedestal (base line) of the waveform. The pulse height value is then calculated by the an integral around the maximum value in the signal region.\\
% The optimisation of the integration window was done by choosing the best \ac{SNR}.\\

\noindent In order to check the dependence on the incident particle flux several rate scans with both bias voltages and different irradiation doses were performed. The typical scan was starting at the minimum flux, going up to the maximum (up scan) and then going down to the minimum again (down scan). Figure \vref{rate3} shows the final results for a \pcvd diamond both non-irradiated and irradiated to \SI{5e14}{n_{eq}\per \centi\meter^2}. No pulse height dependence on particle flux was observed for a flux up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per cm^2}. In addition it can also be seen that there is a slight difference between positive and negative bias. After the irradiation the pulse decreases due to the radiation damage but the values have no absolute calibration yet.
