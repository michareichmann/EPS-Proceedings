In addition to the radiation studies it is also very important to understand the signal behaviour of \ac{CVD} diamonds depending on the incident particle flux since the \ac{HL-LHC} will reach values in the low \SI{}{\giga\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} range. In order to conduct such a study it is import to have the possibility to vary the particle flux in big range. The $\uppi$M1 beam line at the \ac{HIPA} at \ac{PSI} provides such an environment. It has a $\uppi^{\z{+}}$ beam with a spacing of \SI{19.8}{\nano\second} between the bunches with continuously tunable particle fluxes from the order of \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2}. The pion momentum of \SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt\per c} was chosen in order to reach the highest possible flux. \\

described in section \vref{rad}. They have a size of approximately \SI{4x4}{\milli\meter} with a chrome-gold metalisation of \SI{3.5x3.5}{\milli\meter} plus a guard ring on front and back side. In order to resolve single waveforms at high particle rates the sensors are hooked up to a fast, low-noise amplifier with a rise time of approximately \SI{5}{\nano\second} which was custom built at \ac{OSU}. The resulting waveforms are then read out with a DRS4 Evaluation Board at a sampling frequency of \SI{2}{\giga\hertz}. The final diamond pad detectors are then brought into a beam telescope based on the CMS pixel \acp{ROC} PSI46v2 which provides precise tracking with a resolution of \SI{\sim70}{\micro\meter} as well as a trigger which can be scaled in area to increase the efficiency of the data taking. At the end of the telescope sits a scintillator as additional trigger to achieve a precise timing of \SI{1}{\nano\second}. The full setup is shown in figure \vref{rate1}.\\
An overlay of 30000 resulting waveforms is shown in figure \vref{rate2}. The most dominant peak at \SI{70}{\nano\second} relates to the actual particle which was triggered on and is called signal region. All the other peak are secondary particles from other bunches. Due to the good timing resolution the bunch spacing of the \ac{PSI} beam can be clearly seen in the plot. The bunch just before the signal region is forbidden by the trigger logic. Therefore there are no peaks in this area and it is used to extract the pedestal (base line) of the waveform. The pulse height value is then calculated by the an integral with a range of \SI{4}{\nano\second} before and \SI{6}{\nano\second} after the maximum value in the signal region. The optimisation of the integration window was done by choosing the best \ac{SNR}.\\

\noindent In order to check the dependence on the incident particle flux several rate scans with both bias voltages and different irradiation doses were performed. The typical scan was starting at the minimum flux, going up to maximum flux with 4 to 5 steps in between (up scan) and then going down to the minimum flux again (down scan). Several of the up and down scans were done in succession to check for long time effects. Figure \vref{rate3} shows the final results for a \ac{pCVD} diamond both non-irradiated and irradiated to \SI{5e14}{n_{eq}\per \centi\meter^2}. As shown, no pulse height dependence on particle flux was observed for a flux up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per cm^2}. In addition it can also be seen that there is a slight difference between positive and negative bias. After the irradiation the pulse decreases due to the radiation damage but the values have no absolute calibration yet.
