In order to probe the radiation tolerance of \ac{CVD} diamond sensors several radiation studies have been performed varying the types and energies of damaging particles. The sensors were irradiated with protons of different energies (\SI{24}{\giga\electronvolt}, \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}, \SI{70}{\mega\electronvolt}, \SI{25}{\mega\electronvolt}), \SI{\sim1}{\mega\electronvolt} reactor neutrons and \SI{200}{\mega\electronvolt} pions up to a maximum dose of \SI{2.2e16}{p\per\centi\meter^2} which is equivalent to \SI{\sim500}{\mega rad}.\par

In order to build a detector out of a \ac{CVD} diamond sensor a specific recipe is applied where the diamond is cleaned and metallised \cite{kagan}. Depending on the geometry of the metallisation pattern, pad, strip and pixel detectors can be built. For the radiation studies, a strip pattern was chosen in order to correlate the pulse height with the position information.\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PREPARATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In a first step the surface of the raw diamond sensor has to be polished, cleaned and prepared for photo-lithography. Using the photo-lithography a metallisation pattern is then brought on the surface of the diamond. Depending on the pattern three types of detectors can be created: pad, strip and pixel detectors. This process is done for both of the sides of the diamond sensor whereby an almost edgeless design is obtained. By using a segmentation of the detector one can probe the charge of the detector depending on the position of the sensor which is critical for radiation studies. In this case solely strip detectors were used which were then mounted and connected to an amplifier to read out the charge of each strip. An image of the metallisation pattern and an example of a final detector are shown in Figure \vref{rad1}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SETUP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The characterisation of the irradiated devices was performed at a \ac{SPS} beam line at CERN using charged hadrons with momenta of the order of \SI{120}{\giga\electronvolt/c}. By using a customised beam telescope with a spatial resolution of \SI{\sim2}{\micro\meter} one obtains an unbiased hit prediction of the particle track in the diamond sensor.\par
% The schematic setup is shown in Figure \vref{rad2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RESULTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The signal behaviour of irradiated material follows the simple damage equation

\begin{equation}
% 	\z{n} 				&= \z{n}_0 + \z{k}\upphi\\
	\frac{1}{\uplambda} = \frac{1}{\uplambda_0} + \upkappa\upphi \label{erad}
\end{equation}

\noindent
with the initial \ac{MFP} $\uplambda_0$, the damage constant $\upkappa$ and the fluence $\upphi$ \cite{felix}. Since the measurable quantity is the \ac{CCD} we make the assumption that the \ac{MFP} of electrons and holes are the same which was studied in \cite{felix}. Due to that one can find a relation of the \ac{CCD} to the \ac{MFP} .\par
% The \ac{CCD} is the average distance between an electron-hole pair until it is trapped. For a \ac{sc}\ac{CVD} diamond it is about the same size as the its thickness, for the \ac{p}\ac{CVD} the \ac{CCD} is in general smaller than the thickness. In order to find the relation between \ac{CCD} and \ac{MFP} we have to correct our data with some simple assumptions like taking the same \ac{MFP} for electrons and holes. This relates to the following equation:
% \begin{equation}
% 	\frac{\z{ccd}}{\z{t}} = \sum_i \frac{\z{mfp}_i}{\z{t}}\left(1-\frac{\z{mfp}_i}{\z{t}}\left(1-\z{e}^{-\frac{\z{t}}{\z{mfp}_i}}\right)\right)
% \end{equation}
% \noindent
The results of two different types of irradiation are shown in Figure \ref{rad3}. As seen in the examples all of the tested samples follow the equation \ref{erad}. Table \ref{trad} shows all the extracted damage constants.
