It is essential for all modern collider experiments to have an online monitoring of the beam conditions. Since it is important to have these detectors as close as possible to the beam all of the four main experiments at the \ac{LHC} are using detectors with diamond sensors. ATLAS \cite{gorisek}, ALICE, CMS \cite{bartz} and LHCb \cite{domke} all make use of various \acp{BCM} and/or \acp{BLM} based on both \ac{CVD} type diamonds for live background estimations and luminosity measurements.\\
As an upgrade of the \ac{BCM} during the long shutdown in 2014 ATLAS installed the \ac{DBM}. Its purpose is to measure an instantaneous (bunch-by-bunch) luminosity and the bunch-by-bunch position of the beam spot. With its eight telescopes Ã  three detector planes it adds tracking capability to the existing precise \ac{ToF} measurements of the eight pad detectors of the \ac{BCM}. The usage of state of the art pixel detectors based on the FE-I4b readout chip strongly increases the spatial resolution of the monitor and due to its projective geometry pointing towards the interaction region it also can distinguish particles coming from collisions and background \cite{dbm}. The telescopes whereof the sensors of two are made out silicon and the other six out of \ac{p}\ac{CVD} diamond are positioned symmetrically around the beam pipe on both sides of the \ac{IP} and are shown in figure \vref{dbm}. A total number of 45 diamonds with a thickness of \SI{500}{\micro\meter} was available for the project of which the best for chosen for the detector.

Shortly after the installation some of the modules broke (both silicon and diamond)and the \ac{DBM} became non-operational. Nevertheless the first results already look promising as the plots in figure \vref{dbmtrack} proof. They show a clear discrimination between collision and background events. During the shutdown of the \ac{LHC} in the beginning of 2017 the surviving modules were successfully recommissioned and became now a part of the ATLAS data taking.

\noindent
Du to the increasing particle fluence and excellent properties it is likely that diamond detectors become more popularin the future. The current research concentrates on 3D diamond detectors which will be described in section \vref{3D} as a possible candidate for the innermost tracking detectors of the \ac{LHC}. But there is also work towards an upgrade of the \ac{BCM} to the \ac{BCM}' which is designed to provide a fast (bunch-by-bunch) abort system for ATLAS as well as precise luminosity measurement for the \ac{HL-LHC}.
